        <h2>Fragment 94</h2>
        I can reveal to you that I wished to die - <br />
        For with much weeping she left me <br />
        Saying: "Sappho - what suffering is ours! <br />
        For it is against my will that I leave you." <br />
        In answer, I said: "Go, happily remembering me <br />
        For you know what we shared and pursued - <br />
        If not, I wish you to see again our [ former joys ] ..... <br />
        The many braids of rose and violet you [ wreathed ] <br />
        Around yourself at my side <br />
        And the many garlands of flowers <br />
        With which you adorned your soft neck: <br />
        With royal oils from [ fresh flowers ] <br />
        You anointed [ yourself ] <br />
        And on soft beds fufilled your longing <br />
        [ For me ] .... <br />

        She honoured you like a goddess <br />
        And delighted in your choral dance. <br />
        Now she is pre-eminent among the ladies of Lydia <br />
        As the rose-rayed moon after the sinking of the Sun <br />
        Surpasses all the stars and spresads it's light upon the sea <br />
        And the flowers of the fields <br />
        To beautify the spreading dew, freshen roses <br />
        Soft chervil and the flowering melilot .....<br />
        <br />
        Restless, she remembers gentle Atthis - <br />
        Perhaps her subtle judgemnet is burdened <br />
        By your [ fate ] .....<br />
        <br />
        For us, it is not easy to approach <br />
        Goddesses in the beauty of their form <br />
        But you .... <br />
